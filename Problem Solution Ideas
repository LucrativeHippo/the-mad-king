Proceed:
3) Store 5x5

4) Function for all legal moves of a given piece
5) Test
6) Make this function super efficient

*********************************************
ALEX'S NOTE: Pieces can't share the same spot
Have pointer for the pieces' graph position??
Might be better to use dictionary over graph?
Find out what the best way to store this is!!
*********************************************

7) Design a terminal position function to test for game end
----Relates to successor function also super efficient

8) Minimax algorithm
--TEST TEST TEST

9) Design simple game tree

10) Should use successor function interface

11) Try should be to deep
12) Put depth limit on minimax
----Create heuristic eval for things at depth limit
----should report true value of position if it is terminal position
----guesses values for non terminal positions

13) Depth limited minimax works
----develop alpha-beta
----add couple params and conditions to implement

14) Player can play against computer
