- King & Guard may take one step horizontally or vertically but not diagonoly (similar to Rooks)
- If the King's movement is blocked by a Guard, and the space following is unoccupied, the King may **hop** over the Guard.
- Players must make a move if possible.
- If a player can't move and isn't in another endgame state the game is a draw
- Kings team wins if the King reaches the Dragon's home row
- Dragons win if the King is surrounded by at least three Dragons and the King can't move

- If a Guard is surrounded by at least 3 dragons, the Guard is captured and replaced by a Dragon (This happens immediately regardless of who's turn it is)
- Guards can capture a Dragon if the Dragon is adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) to at least 2 Guards.
- When captured, the Dragon is removed from the board, and one of the guards moves into the place formerly occupied by the Dragon. 
    - This is more like a traditional capture in chess.  It is not immediate as in the capture of a Guard.)
    - If Player 1 moves a Guard to a position that completes the 2-Guard formation, Player 2 can still move the Dragon away from the threat of capture.  
    - Player 1 may choose not to capture the Dragon.
