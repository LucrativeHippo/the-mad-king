Guard is surrounded by at least 3 dragons, captured guard is removed from board and replaced by dragon
^--happens immediately regardless of who's turn it is

Guards can capture a Dragon if the Dragon is adjacent (horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally) to at least 2 Guards.
When captured, the Dragon is removed from the board, and one of the guards moves into the place formerly occupied by the Dragon.
This is more like a traditional capture in chess.  It is not immediate as in the capture of a Guard.  
If Player 1 moves a Guard to a position that completes the 2-Guard formation, 
Player 2 can still move the Dragon away from the threat of capture.  
Player 1 may choose not to capture the Dragon.
